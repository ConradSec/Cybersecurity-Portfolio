> I worked with a team to develop a Python-based
  crypter used to obfuscate executable files,
  allowing them to run on Windows 10 and 11
  without interference. I found communication
  with my peers was key, ensuring each part of
  development was properly coordinated and done
  to a proper standard.
              
> We used: Python, PyInstaller, AES Encryption,
  Base64 Encoding, XOR Obfuscation,
  Windows API Calls, and PE File Manipulation.
              
> How did it work?
  - The crypter encrypted an executable file using
    AES and XOR to obscure its contents.
  - A Python stub was developed to decrypt and
    inject the payload into memory using Windows
    API calls.
  - To evade detection, we implemented
    process-hollowing and dynamically resolved
    API functions.
  - Base64 encoding and entropy padding helped
    prevent signature-based detection.
              
> Team Collaboration & Communication:
  - We divided tasks based on our individual
    skills. Some worked on encryption methods,
    while others handled execution techniques.
  - We held regular talks to discuss the project
    and make sure every module of it was working
    smoothly.
  - Code reviews and testing helped us refine
    the program and make certain that there were
    no major bugs.
  - Clear documentation of each change we made
    was very useful as it allowed us to go back
    to fix any mistakes that were made and
    fix them.
              
> Execution & Evasion:
  - The stub focused on in-memory execution to
    reduce antivirus detection.
  - Each encrypted payload was unique, preventing
    signature-based detection.
              
> Use Case & Ethical Considerations:
  - This project was built as a proof of concept
    to understand modern detection
    evasion techniques.
  - By creating and studying such programs,
    security researchers can develop more effective
    countermeasures, ensuring stronger defenses
    against ever-evolving threats.
