> I wrote a Batch script which would run Powershell
  commands, these commands would inject a DLL
  into memory. This would evade static detection
  as well as executing a payload without the
  payload needing to be written to disk.
  

> I used: PowerShell, Windows API,
  Process Hollowing, and Batch Scripting.
  

>How did it work?
- The DLL injection leveraged process hollowing
  to inject the payload into a benign,
  non-suspicious Windows process, making detection
  extremely difficult by bypassing traditional
  anti-virus tools.
- A batch file was used to automate the injection,
  which would then pull a RAT (Remote Access Tool)
  from an virtual private server and execute it on
  the victim machine, ensuring the payload remained
  fully undetectable (FUD).
- Persistence was maintained through the injected
  payload itself, which would run during startup,
  ensuring continued access even after reboots.
  

> Testing & Challenges:
- The primary challenge was ensuring the payload
  was FUD, as scanning it with any malware
  detection tool would generate signatures
  and potentially flag the file.
  So instead, I tested the payload on multiple
  Windows virtual machines and virtual private
  servers to test the likelyhood of detetction.
  

> Practical Applications & Thoughts:
- This type of malware injection could be used in
  targeted attacks, such as compromising corporate
  systems in industries like insurance, where an
  attacker could remotely control employees'
  systems and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- It provided valuable insights into the dangers
  of seemingly harmless files, significantly
  increasing my awareness of the importance of
  securing systems and myself against such
  attacks in the future.
