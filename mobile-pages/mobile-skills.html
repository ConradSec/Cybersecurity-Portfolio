Network Penetration Testing:
> Experience:  
  - I've spent many hours on Hack The Box, focusing
    primarily on network penetration testing and
    database exploitation using programs like
    Silverbullet and other similar tools.
  - Recently, I discovered a CSRF vulnerability in
    a web application, which I promptly reported
    to the person running it.
    
> Programming Skills:
 - Python:  
     I'm comfortable using Python and have used
     it in many of my projects, including making
     crypters and obfuscating executable files.
     Additionally, I frequently use Python for
     tasks such as properly formatting and
     cleaning up databases.

 - C++:  
     I initially began learning C++, but my
     focus shifted towards network penetration
     testing, which led me to prioritize networking
     skills over further C++ development.
    
> Networking & Security:
  - Generalized Knowledge:  
    Although I'm focused on network penetration
    testing, I want to continue to expand my
    knowledge and skills, especially with tools
    like Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Aircrack,
    and Airodump. I prefer to maintain a
    generalized skillset but am considering
    specializing in certain areas, such as
    cloud security and network security.
      
  - Tools Used:  
   • Wireshark: I use it for network sniffing
     and analyzing traffic to identify potential
     vulnerabilities.

   • Nmap: A tool I feel confident with, as I
     know various commands and have used it in
     a variety of network assessments.

   • Aircrack & Hydra: I've utilized these tools
     for hash cracking and Wi-Fi security testing.
    
   • Metasploit: I use it extensively for
     exploitation in penetration testing
     engagements.

   • Wireshark: For network sniffing and
     packet analysis.

   • SQLMap: I use it for automating SQL injection
     attacks and testing databases.
    
> Operating Systems & Environments:
  - I primarily use Kali Linux for cybersecurity
    tasks due to its robust penetration testing
    tools and versatility.
    However, I'm also comfortable with Windows,
    Mac and most Linux distros, providing me with
    flexibility to work across various systems
    and environments.
    
> Social Engineering:  
  - I've experimented with social engineering
    tactics, such as convincing individuals to
    run a trojan disguised as free game exploits.
    Instead of the trojan acting as malware,
    it would open notepad.exe and paste a couple
    paragraphs I wrote about computer security
    and uploaded to pastebin before deleting itself.

  - I rely heavily on public data records and
    custom OSINT tools to gather valuable
    information. One of my favorite tools was
    created by a friend, which scrapes social media
    platforms like Instagram and TikTok for
    username matches or similar names.
    This has been a valuable asset when
    investigating potential targets or
    gathering intelligence for assessments.
