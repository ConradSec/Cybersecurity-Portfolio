> Penetration Testing Certifications (HTB CPTS):
  - I'm currently working towards the Hack The Box
    Pentester certification, which has had its
    challenges but has been highly rewarding.
    My focus is on building a deeper
    understanding of Active Directory and
    networking, although I've also worked on
    web application exploitation.
    
> Cloud Security (AWS):
  - I've been actively working through the
    AWS Academy Cloud Foundations program.
    I find cloud security to be incredibly
    important because of the rapid adoption
    of cloud computing solutions.

    It's clear that the need for cybersecurity
    professionals, experienced in Cloud Computer
    will rapdily increase in future years,
    and I aim to be part of this growing sector.
    
> Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis:
    - I have dabbled in reverse engineering
      malware, which allowed me to deconstruct
      and understand how malicious code works.
      This experience helped me identify flaws in
      malware, and given me a chance to find ways
      to improve it, as well as find ways to defend
      from similar threats in the future.
    
> Career Opportunities I'm Interested In:
  - Network Technician:
    I would consider pursuing a role as a network
    technician, where I could leverage my
    understanding of how data flows through networks.
    This knowledge is imperative to identify
    vulnerabilities and attack vectors, whilst also
    working on implementing solutions to mitigate
    potential risks.

  - Cybersecurity Engineer:
    A position as a cybersecurity engineer is
    another role that peaks my interest.
    I'm particularly interested in working with
    network security, firewalls, and IDS/IPS
    systems. However I have really enjoyed projects
    I've worked on that are to do with malware and
    exploiting vulnerabilities, so that area would
    also interest me a lot.

    As time goes on, and cyber-attacks become more
    advanced, I think it is a MUST that I continue
    learning and experimenting with different ways
    to defend against attacks, as such experience
    would be vital in being succesfull in many
    different job roles.
      
  - Forensic Computer Analyst:
    Digital forensics has always been a field I
    find fascinating, and I would love to explore
    a career as a forensic computer analyst.
    
    Working with the police, or other private
    companies would give me a great chance to learn
    and develop my skills. I enjoy hardware
    hacking, and cracking decryption keys.
    So I think a job where that would be the
    main objective would suit me well.
