> I worked with a team to develop a Python-based crypter used to obfuscate executable files,
  allowing them to run on Windows 10 and 11 without interference.
  I found communication with my peers was key, ensuring each part of development was properly
  coordinated and done to a proper standard.

> We used: Python, PyInstaller, AES Encryption, Base64 Encoding, XOR Obfuscation,
  Windows API Calls, and PE File Manipulation.

> How did it work?
  - The crypter encrypted an executable file using AES and XOR to obscure its contents.
  - A Python stub was developed to decrypt and inject the payload into memory using
    Windows API calls.
  - To evade detection, we implemented process hollowing and dynamically resolved
    API functions.
  - Base64 encoding and entropy padding helped prevent signature-based detection.

> Team Collaboration & Communication:
  - We divided tasks based on our individual skills. Some worked on encryption methods, 
    while others handled execution techniques.
  - We held regular talks to discuss the project and make sure every module of it was
    working smoothly.
  - Code reviews and testing helped us refine the program and make certain that there were
    no major bugs.
  - Clear documentation of each change we made was very useful as it allowed us to go back
    to fix any mistakes that were made and fix them.

> Execution & Evasion:
  - The stub focused on in-memory execution to reduce antivirus detection.
  - Each encrypted payload was unique, preventing signature-based detection.

> Use Case & Ethical Considerations:
  - This project was built as a proof of concept to understand modern detection evasion techniques.
  - By creating and studying such programs, security researchers can develop more
    effective countermeasures, ensuring stronger defenses against ever-evolving threats.
